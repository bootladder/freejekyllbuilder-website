- section: A Free Jekyll Builder For You!
  text: |
    If you have multiple non-technical writers, building Jekyll sites locally is not an option, so you build on the cloud.  You can set up Travis to build your site, you can build on your own server, or you can use **freejekyllbuilder.com**.

    **Build your site:**   
      
    First zip it up at the root and note its location.  
    ```
    zip -r sitesource.zip *;  mv sitesource.zip /tmp
    ```
    Then curl it up to freejekyllbuilder.com  
    ```
    curl -F 'doesntmatter=@/tmp/sitesource.zip' freejekyllbuilder.com/upload/mygeneratedusername1
    ```
    Wait for the response, and you are ready to download!   
      
    **Download your site:** 
    ```
    wget freejekyllbuilder.com/download/mygeneratedusername1
    ```
    **Deploy your site:**  
    You know what to do.  Unzip the _site and deploy the contents in your web root!

    To understand this particular site, notice the `.travis.yml` and the `cibuild`.  
    Travis will execute the `cibuild` script.  
    The `cibuild` script:  zips the source, uploads to freejekyllbuilder.com.  
    But notice, instead of downloading the built site, it triggers a webhook.  
    The receiver of that webhook knows the URL to download from.  
    The receiver downloads the built site, unzips, and deploys to the web root.
       
    Here's another one <https://github.com/bootladder/blog> , <http://blog.bootladder.com>
    
    You can even do local builds!  The same
    script that Travis would run, cibuild,
    can  be run locally.  Just look at it,
    it's simple!

    I'm not a tool master yet so looking for more examples of different source site architectures.
