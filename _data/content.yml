- section: A Free Jekyll Builder For You!
  text: |
    If you have multiple non-technical writers, building Jekyll sites locally is not an option, so you build on the cloud.  You can set up Travis to build your site, you can build on your own server, or you can use **freejekyllbuilder.com**.

    **Build your site:**   
      
    First zip it up at the root and note its location.  
    ```
    zip -r sitesource.zip *;  mv sitesource.zip /tmp
    ```
    Then curl it up to freejekyllbuilder.com.  
    ```
    curl -F 'doesntmatter=@/tmp/source.zip' freejekyllbuilder.com/upload/mygeneratedusername1
    ```
    Wait for the response, and you are ready to download!   
      
    **Download your site:** 
    ```
    wget freejekyllbuilder.com/download/mygeneratedusername1
    ```

    Here is some explanation            layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
